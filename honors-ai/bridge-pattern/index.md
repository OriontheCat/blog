## What is it about?
A remimplementation of my flocking program to utilize the bridge pattern.
## How I Approached It
I removed the "blit" function and made Agent an abstract function, and made several Agent classes I could use such as RedAgent, and SimpelAgent.
## What are the Challenges you Faced
I started off rewriting my graph-searching program into a CLI and a web app, but it was taking too much time.
