## What is it about?
A braitenburg vehicle is a vehicle with heat sensors hooked up to motors. Our job was to make a simulation of this with code.
## How I Approached It
I used a heavily class based p5.js implimentation of the vehicles as you can see here: [Code](https://github.com/orionthecat/braitenburg-vehicles)
## What are the Challenges you Faced
I started to make the aggression vehicle by simply making a point go toward my mouse, and limiting the distance it could travel. I found that this made the vehicle rotate too fast. So I made a vehicle with two sensors that rotated based on the difference of the detected heat of the two sensors. I also tried to make an edit mode where you would click on a place on the screen and it would move the vehicle there, I also made a bunch of sliders and inputs for speed and rotation, but it would move the to a button, whenever I clicked it, so I scrapped the idea.
