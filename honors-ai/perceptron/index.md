# Boolean Tree
[Link](https://github.com/OriontheCat/perceptron/)
## What is it about?
A perceptron that classifies a 2d point with a value of 1 or 0
## How I Approached It
I was forced to use Java (RIP [dart](https://www.dartlang.org/), best language 2019).
## What are the Challenges you Faced
I had trouble calculating the error because I subtracted the actual y value from the output instead of subtracting if the y value was bigger than 0 which resulted in really weird results. I had a hard time finding this error because I am not used to using the debugger for java. Please just let me use [dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) :).
