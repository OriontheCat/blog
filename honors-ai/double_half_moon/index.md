## What is it about?
A python script to classify two half moons that can't be solved linearly
## How I Approached It
I used keras and google colaboratory because it is a quick and easy solution, and I was sick.
## What are the Challenges you Faced
I had trouble manipulating the numpy matricies because I don't use python very often.
